# DataStructure Demos and Examples

A collection of DataStructure experiments I've created, now open source and on GitHub, so please go ahead and help me hack this resource in to a wealth of demos that other authors can learn from.

# Aim

* If a user can hit view source on the demo, then we've done our job
* All content is open source and just enjoy it
* Individual demos, if authored by someone other than [@westhacker](http://twitter.com) can be credited as appropriate

# Language

* C
* C++

# Develop Tool

* Visual Studio 2010

# HeapSortMFCSample

* 堆积排序(Heapsort)是指利用堆积树（堆）这种资料结构所设计的一种排序算法，可以利用数组的特点快速定位指定索引的元素。
* Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm to create a sorted array (or list), and is part of the selection sort family. Although somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort, it has the advantage of a more favorable worst-case O(n log n) runtime. Heapsort is an in-place algorithm, but it is not a stable sort.
