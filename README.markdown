# DataStructure Demos and Examples

A collection of DataStructure experiments I've created, now open source and on GitHub, so please go ahead and help me hack this resource in to a wealth of demos that other authors can learn from.

# Aim

* All content is open source and just enjoy it
* Individual demos, if authored by someone other than [@westhacker](http://twitter.com) can be credited as appropriate
