# DataStructure Demos and Examples

A collection of DataStructure experiments I've created, now open source and on GitHub, so please go ahead and help me hack this resource in to a wealth of demos that other authors can learn from.

# Aim

* If a user can hit view source on the demo, then we've done our job
* All content is open source and just enjoy it
* Individual demos, if authored by someone other than [@westhacker](http://twitter.com) can be credited as appropriate

# Language

* C
* C++

# Develop Tool

* Visual Studio 2010

# Content



# Thanks

Thanks for your reading and happy coding
